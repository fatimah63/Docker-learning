# Docker Learning 🐳  

## Overview  
This repository is dedicated to my experiments with **Docker** and **containerisation**. It serves as a learning space where I explore containerised applications, Dockerfiles, and best practices for deploying software in isolated environments.  

## What You'll Find Here  
- Dockerfiles for different projects  
- Experiments with containers and images  
- Notes on Docker commands and workflows  
- Examples of containerised applications  

## Why Docker?  
Docker allows for:  
✅ **Consistent environments** across machines  
✅ **Lightweight virtualisation** compared to traditional VMs  
✅ **Simplified deployments** with container orchestration
